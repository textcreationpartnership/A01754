            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Againe to his ſonne Iacob in the .xxviii. of Geneſis al the kynreds of the earthe ſhalbe bleſſed in the, and thy ſeede ſaythe the Lorde. Agayne ſaithe Iacob in the ſpyryte of Prophecye to hys chyldrene. The ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall not bee taken frome Iuda, nor the ruler from his ſeat whyles that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiah do come, and to him ſhal the people be gathered. Loo thus by playne teſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies mooſte auncient, euen from the beginninge maye it bee proued Meſſiah oure Chriſt to be appoynted man of the ſeede of manne. And after the troublous tymes when all theyr captaines fayled, as Micha dyd Prophecy, then forthe of a litle village of the tribe of Iuda ſhuld come oure Chriſte, the appointed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted ruler ouer the faithful Iſrael. And to let you vnderſtande whyche are the ennemyes to Chriſt his kyngdome, that you do ſtriue in vayne there againſt mark that Balaam prouoked bi y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, Balaac colde ſpeake nothyng agaynſte thys kingdome which he did ſe more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thouſand .d. yeres to come after hym: but dydde reuerence it a farre of ſaying:

Thus are the enemyes of oure Chriſte compelled to knoweledge hym a man of the ſeede of Iacob, and a gloryous kynge ouer all hys ennemyes tryumphynge. Agayne. Deut. xviii. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſeruaunte of God dare ſay thus.

For ſo ſtandeth the Hebrewe. Beware therfore as Eſay ſayth, and take hede vnto your ſelues from the man whoſe breathe is in hys noſtrelles for wherin he is reputed, though he be very man and therfore deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, yet is he of the Lorde onlye regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

And in the Pſal. cxxx. moſt playnelye. The Lorde hathe ſworne to Dauid and wyll not deceyue. I wyll ſet vpon thy ſeate the fruite of thy wombe the whyche place holy Peter alledginge to the Iewes.

And if you do ſtycke of the woorde and name of a manne, reade .iii. kinges .ii. chapter. Thou ſhalte alwaye haue a manne to ſit in thy ſeat ouer Iſrael, and in the ende, the ſeate of Dauid ſhall bee ſtable before the Lorde for euer.

                  <p>Like as oure Prophete dothe mooſte plainelye painte him foorthe in boothe kindes, alſo ſayinge that he ſhoulde be borne in Bethlem, a village of ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putacion, becauſe it was able too make but a ſmall noumber in the muſters and taxes when the people were noum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by hondrethes and thouſandes as was then vſed, and we doo vſe the ſame ſtyll to thys daye. The whyche woordes of oure Prophete that hee ſhoulde come foorthe of lytle Bethlehem to rule ouer Iſraell doothe declare hys mannehode lyke as the woordes folowing.

               <p>The cauſe is that they whiche do fear the Lorde are alwaies ready with heart and minde to do thinges pleaſaunt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and to abſtaine from the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. His diſpleaſure do they feare like lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge

Hereby doo wee gyue glorye and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppe vnto God, that is too ſay: we knoweledge hym too be true in all hys promyſes. And becauſe without faythe it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, this faith maketh vs ſuer that wee doo worſhippe hym as wee ſhoulde, and certifieth vs that wee bee the chyldrene of God and that oure woorckes are acceptable in hys ſyghte. Hereby did Abell in hys ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryfyce more truly worſhyppe God then dyd hys brother Caine.

               <p>Shortelye too conclude, this faith is it that cauſeth true worſhyppe. For whatſoeuer commeth not of faythe the fame is ſynne. And becauſe faythe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of the hearyng of the word of God only &amp; of no mans fanſy, we may boldly

To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhe the wearye whych he calleth alſo the refreſhinge of his owne ſelfe. Thus doo we keepe the acceptable holye day, and doo the worſhippe that he deſyreth when wee ſhewe mercye, and comforte the poore and neadye. The whyche wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhyppe is ſo greate, that he wyl aſke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptes of none other thynge at the daye of iudgemente, but if we haue clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed him, when we did ſee him naked, if we haue fedde him when he was hongry and ſo foorthe. Math. xxv. For becauſe theeſe dedes of mercye and loue, doothe preſuppoſe, boothe faythe and feare of God. This loue therefore muſt we bring to the true worſhyppynge of God. And as oure Prophete in fewe woordes doth comprehende all kynde of worſhyppe, wee muſte doo iudgemente, loue, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye, and walcke humblye and reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye before the Lorde. Too do iudgment

To do mercye, is to forgeue as thou wold be forgeuen, and thys hart and mynd muſt we bring to worſhyp god, &amp; to walke before hym. For of thys doth God make tryal whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do loue hym or no. If we do not loue our brother whom we ſe, how can we loue God whom we ſe not?

Therefore may we not thyncke to pleaſe God wyth any ſacrifyce, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſhewe of holynes, but wee muſte walke humblye and obedyentlyee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lorde, as Samuell anſwered kynge Saule .i.

               <p>Enok walked thus wyth God, and therefore was taken vp into hys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.

               <p>Abraham and Sarai may bee exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples howe we ſhoulde walke humblye, and reuerentelye, and alſo faythfullye and obedyentlye before the Lord, which after promiſe or commaundement, dyd not regard any thyng, not ſo muche as theyr owne old barran bodyes but only looked vnto God, geuyng him thys ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure, worſhyppe and glorye, that hee was able to fulfil whatſoeuer he hadde ſpoken and promyſed. And whyche oughte to be our glaſſe, therein too ſee the woorkes of God towarde vs. Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell ſo long as they dyd walke humblye, and obedyentlye before theyr Lorde, and worſhypped hym after hys woorde and commaundementes, fearyng hym wyth vnfayned and diſſemblyng harts, harkenyng vnto hys word, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theyr lyues therafter. He led theym

But when they dyd ſwarue from hys commaundement, and would wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp hym after theyr owne inuencyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he plaged them greuouſlye, ſente them drought, dearth, famine, peſtilence, and the ſwerd of the Egiptians, Chaldees, and Romaynes.</p>
               <p>Eſpicially when God the father ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hys owne ſon to cal them to hys obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to teach them that theyr ſlain ſacrifice was of no force in it ſelfe, but onelye dyd ſygnifye that by hys bloude and ſacrifice of hym, beyng as it wer an vnſpotted lambe, theyr iniquity ſhould be forgeuen, and the ſyn of theyr ſouls waſhed away, whych was ſygnified by hys baptyme. They walkyng proundly not humbly, deſpyſed humble Chriſte, boaſted them ſelues to bee the chyldren of Abraham, to be the true Iſraelytes, to haue the oracles, to haue the law wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten, to be obſeruers and keepers of the law, to be the only worſhyppers of god, to know hys wyl, to be guydes vnto the blynde and all together: but Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the moſt holy amonges them, blind guydes, paynted graues, fayned hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,

So perilous a thynge it is, not to walcke humblye before him, but to gad otherwayes from hym, for the reſpecte of anye creature.
